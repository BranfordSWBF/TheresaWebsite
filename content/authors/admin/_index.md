I am a rising senior majoring in computer science and mathematics at Yale University, interning at <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/" target="_blank">Bridgewater</a> for summer 2019. 

I love exploring interdisciplinary applications of research and technology. I work as a research assistant with professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coifman" target="_blank">Ronald Coifman</a> on analysis and visualization techniques for high dimensional data. I have done computer vision development at the <a href="https://scazlab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale Social Robotics Lab</a> and consulting work in feature detection. 

I am part of <a href="https://ysiginvest.com/" target="_blank">Yale Student Investment Group</a>, and previously served as treasurer for <a href="http://steamwith.us/YaleSTEAM.html" target="_blank">Yale STEAM
</a>. I enjoy running, painting, and performing classical music in my spare time.
